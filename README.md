**A passionate and dedicated game programmer, deeply in love with the world of programming and game development.** My learning adventure began in 2017 when I discovered the joy of creating games as a hobby. In 2022, I joined the [ITI (Information Technology Institute)](https://iti.gov.eg/about-us) to further develop my skills and pursue a career in game development.

Check out the courses I completed during my ITI game development scholarship [ITI Game Dev Courses](https://rgateway.iti.gov.eg/Resources/Resources/GetResourceFile?PublicId=d30e0a2b-906d-44f8-9bf7-09a71bfccca7&Size=). ðŸŽ“

In my Unity learning journey, I've crafted engaging projects showcasing proficiency in AI, UI design, VFX, networking, custom tools, and more. [Check out my portfolio](https://rayan-yousef.webnode.page) for the full experience! ðŸ”¥
